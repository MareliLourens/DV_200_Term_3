## About the project:

### Product mockup:

### Project description:
I started a project to develop an online ecommerce store using react for the frontend and MongoDB for the backend. One particularly exciting aspect of this endeavor was the opportunity to delve into the realm of APIs by creating my very first custom API.
Given the wealth of information available, I was aware of the potential overwhelm in comprehending it all, especially in the context of managing a store with an extensive product catalogue. My primary objective was to engineer an intelligent algorithm capable of sifting through this abundance of data, unveiling hidden patterns and correlations that might elude human observation.
To initiate this project, I meticulously designed the APIs that would serve as the foundation of my work. Armed with these APIs, I immersed myself in the coding process, constructing a web application optimized for handling substantial data loads with efficiency. Simultaneously, I was dedicated to crafting user-friendly visual representations that not only facilitated the exploration of data but also empowered users to uncover novel insights.

### Built with:
For this project, I utilized React and Node.js, as well as advanced Javascript and Axios.

## Getting Started:

### Prerequisites:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Features and Functionality:

The web application is structured around four primary user-facing pages. The initial page serves as the home screen, showcasing products categorized into three sections: "Featured," "New Arrivals," and "Discounted." This allows the user to select one of the products that will take them to the individual product page. Correspondingly, on the products page, all available products are displayed, enabling users to pick a specific item for more detailed information on its dedicated individual product page. Should a user decide to purchase a chosen product, an "Add to Cart" button is provided, facilitating the inclusion of the item within their cart for future checkout.

On the admin side, two distinct pages cater to administrative tasks. The first page deals with inventory management, granting administrators the ability to modify existing products or generate new ones. The second page is dedicated to order processing, affording administrators an overview of incoming orders and the means to fulfill and dispatch them.

## Concept Process:

### Ideation:

In the initial brainstorming stage of the project, I opted to draw inspiration from the game "Genshin Impact" developed by Hoyoverse. This choice influenced the overall structure of my ecommerce store. The primary concept was to establish a platform where users could make purchases of in-game characters from "Genshin Impact." To lay the groundwork, I began by designing an API that revolved around these characters, encompassing their associated details. This data served as the foundation for what users would ultimately see. While certain elements of the project naturally evolved as development progressed, the fundamental principles of modeling the store around the game's characters remained constant.

## Development Process

### Highlights

Personally, I found the experience of working on this project to be immensely rewarding. One of the key highlights for me was the opportunity to futher develop my skills in the programming language, React.

Another aspect of the project that I found particularly enjoyable was the chance to further improve my understanding of APIs. As someone who has worked with APIs in the past, I was already familiar with the basic concepts and principles involved. However, this project allowed me to delve deeper into the topic and gain a more nuanced understanding of how APIs work, how to use them effectively, and how to troubleshoot issues that might arise. By creating my own API it helped me gain further insight into how they are structured.

Overall, I feel that this project was an incredibly valuable learning experience for me. Not only did it allow me to expand my skill set and gain a deeper understanding of key concepts and techniques, but it also gave me the opportunity to work on a real-world project with practical applications. I look forward to building on what I've learned and continuing to grow and develop as a programmer and developer in the future.

### Challenges

Over the duration of this project, I encountered several obstacles that stretched my skill set and took me beyond my familiar territory. Among these challenges, a particularly noteworthy hurdle emerged in connection with the API creation process. Specifically, I grappled with incorporating local images into the API, struggling to identify an effective method. My initial attempts involved utilizing Google Drive links for image hosting, followed by attempts to utilize localhost IDs for display, both of which proved unsuccessful. Ultimately, after conducting research, I found success in employing the Multer method.

While the project undoubtedly presented substantial challenges, I view it as an invaluable learning journey. Navigating the complexities tied to the API and charts forced me to expand my developer capabilities and gain novel problem-solving insights. Reflecting on the project, a sense of accomplishment fills me as I consider what I managed to achieve. I eagerly anticipate applying these newfound lessons to upcoming ventures and obstacles.

## Future Implementation

Reflecting on my work on this project, there are several areas where I feel there is room for improvement and further development. One of the key areas where I would like to focus in the future is on stabilizing the code and improving consistency. While I was able to get the code working effectively for the purposes of this project, I feel that there is room for improvement in terms of streamlining the code, making it more efficient, and reducing redundancies. In addition, I would like to develop a more consistent coding style and documentation approach, to make the code more accessible to others and easier to maintain over time.

Another area where I would like to expand and enhance the project is in making it more interactive and engaging for users. While the website is functional and provides a useful service, I believe that there is room to add more interactivity and animation to the site, in order to make it more visually appealing and engaging for users. This might involve developing new features and functionalities, such as interactive maps or dynamic data visualizations, or adding subtle animations and effects to various elements of the site.
